# Automating_Python
This is an automation project using Python.     
This project is about converting a PDF file to an audio file.       
The PDF file is first converted to a text file using the PyPDF2 library and then the text file is converted to an audio file using the pyttsx3 library.     
The file used in this project is the [Automating the Boring Stuff with Python](https://github.com/imisi99/Automating-Python/blob/main/Automate%20the%20Boring%20Stuff%20with%20Python.pdf) book.      
The project can be cloned and run on your local machine.        
 -      pip install requirements.txt
 -      python main.py

You can set the audio speed and the voice of the audio file in the main.py file.
The default audio name is automation.mp3.
